## Business Task
Danny is expanding his new Pizza Empire and at the same time, he wants to Uberize it, so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## üßº Data Cleaning & Transformation

### üî® Table: customer_orders
**```customer_orders```**
- Converting ```null``` and ```NaN``` values into blanks ```''``` in ```exclusions``` and ```extras```
  - Blanks indicate that the customer requested no extras/exclusions for the pizza, whereas ```null``` values would be ambiguous.
- Saving the transformations in a temporary table ```customer_orders_temp```
  - We want to avoid permanently changing the raw data via ```UPDATE``` commands if possible.

```sql
      CREATE TEMP TABLE
      	customer_orders_temp AS
      	SELECT
      		order_id,
      		customer_id,
      		pizza_id,
      		CASE
      			WHEN exclusions IS NULL or exclusions LIKE 'null' THEN ''
      			ELSE exclusions
      			END AS exclusions,
      		CASE
      			WHEN extras IS NULL or extras LIKE 'null' THEN ''
      			ELSE extras
      			END AS extras,
      		order_time
      	FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;
  # Check the new temporary table
      SELECT
      	*

### üî® Table: runner_orders
**```runner_orders```**

- Converting ```'null'``` text values into null values for ```pickup_time```, ```distance``` and ```duration```
- Extracting only numbers and decimal spaces for the distance and duration columns
  - Use regular expressions and ```NULLIF``` to convert non-numeric entries to null values
- Converting blanks, ```'null'``` and ```NaN``` into null values for cancellation
- Saving the transformations in a temporary table ```runner_orders_temp```
```sql

## Solution

## A. Pizza Metrics

**How many pizzas were ordered?**
```sql
    SELECT
    	COUNT(*) AS pizza_order_count
    FROM customer_orders_temp;
```
| pizza_order_count |
| ----------------- |
| 14                |

---
**How many unique customer orders were made?**
```sql
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS unique_order_count
    FROM customer_orders_temp;
```
| unique_order_count |
| ------------------ |
| 10                 |

---
**How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?**
```sql
    SELECT 
      runner_id, 
      COUNT(order_id) AS successful_orders
    FROM runner_orders_temp
    WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY runner_id
    ORDER BY runner_id ASC;
```
| runner_id | successful_orders |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| 1         | 4                 |

| 3         | 1                 |

---
**How many of each type of pizza was delivered?**
```sql
    SELECT 
    	customer_orders_temp.pizza_id AS pizza_type, 
    	pizza_runner.pizza_names.pizza_name,
    	COUNT(runner_orders_temp.order_id) AS delivered_pizza

    WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY pizza_type, pizza_runner.pizza_names.pizza_name
    ORDER BY pizza_type ASC;

**How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?**
```sql
    SELECT  
        customer_orders_temp.customer_id,
        pizza_runner.pizza_names.pizza_name,
    	COUNT(customer_orders_temp.pizza_id) AS ordered_pizza

    GROUP BY pizza_runner.pizza_names.pizza_name, customer_orders_temp.customer_id
    ORDER BY customer_orders_temp.customer_id ASC;
```

| 105         | Vegetarian | 1             |

**What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?**
```sql
    WITH pizza_per_order AS(
    	SELECT
    		customer_orders_temp.order_id, 
    		COUNT(customer_orders_temp.pizza_id) AS ordered_pizza

**For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?**
```sql
