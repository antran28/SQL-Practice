**Query #6: Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**
````sql
WITH SaleHistory AS (
	SELECT
  		dannys_diner.sales.customer_id, 
		dannys_diner.sales.order_date,
		dannys_diner.menu.product_name,

        ON dannys_diner.sales.product_id = dannys_diner.menu.product_id
	WHERE dannys_diner.sales.order_date > dannys_diner.members.join_date
)
SELECT DISTINCT ON (customer_id) customer_id, product_name
FROM SaleHistory
ORDER BY customer_id ASC;
````
#### In this query:
- We create a CTE (SaleHistory) that joins the members, sales, and menu tables based on the customer_id and product_id. We also filter for purchases that occurred after the customer's membership start date.
- Within the CTE, we use the ORDER BY clause to order the results by customer_id and purchase_date. This helps us identify the first purchase after becoming a member for each customer.
- In the main query, we use DISTINCT ON (customer_id) to select only the first row for each customer, ensuring that we get only the first purchase after becoming a member.
This query will give you the first item purchased by each customer after they became a member.
#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | ramen        |
| B           | sushi        |

**Query #7: Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**
````sql

  		INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu 
        ON dannys_diner.sales.product_id = dannys_diner.menu.product_id
	WHERE dannys_diner.sales.order_date < dannys_diner.members.join_date
)
SELECT DISTINCT ON (customer_id) customer_id, product_name
FROM SaleHistory
ORDER BY customer_id ASC;
````

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | sushi        |
| B           | sushi        |

**Query #8: What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**
````sql

	SUM(dannys_diner.menu.price) AS total_spent

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_items | total_sales |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2 |  25       |
| B           | 3 |  40       |

**Query #9: If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**
````sql
SELECT
  	dannys_diner.sales.customer_id, 
	SUM(
		CASE 
			WHEN dannys_diner.menu.product_name = 'sushi'
			THEN 20 * dannys_diner.menu.price
			ELSE 10 * dannys_diner.menu.price

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 860 |
| B           | 940 |
